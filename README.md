<h1>Project eLibray</h1>
<br>
<p>
It's a really old website project (actually, one of my first) that I created for my school while being a computer science student.
</p>

<p>
I used basic php and apache as backend and css and javascript for front-end. In spite of that, the code is hilariously hacky and boged together.  
</p>

<p>
I am keeping this project up on my github because here is where it all started. This is the project that ignited that coder inside me. These were the first times I was-up all night, coding away on my ancient pentium machine, fixing away infinite loops in the code.
