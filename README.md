##Licensing

##Programming Language
-----------
Out of the vast umber of language, we found PHP, MySql, And Apache Server to be best suited for our project needs given the need for 100% compatibility b/w different platforms.

##Documentation
-----------
All of the code is heavily commented so there may not be need for a seperate documentaion but community efforts are welcomed. You might want to create an issue if you don't understand the code.

##Softwares and tools
-----------
Our dedicated team LOVES free softwares! We use Eclipse for php coding and debugging and currently targeting Html5 browsers. Project Uses and include Jquery and Gsap Libraries and code styleshet in basic CSS. We are hoping for an cross-browser, cross-platform and cross-device compatiblity by the end of the project.
