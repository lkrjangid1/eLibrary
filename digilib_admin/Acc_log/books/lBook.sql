His clerk, Bob Cratchit, shivers in the anteroom because Scrooge refuses to spend money on heating coals for a fire. Scrooge\\\'s nephew, Fred, pays his uncle a visit and invites him to his annual Christmas party. Two portly gentlemen also drop by and ask Scrooge for a contribution to their charity.

Marley, looking haggard and pallid, relates his unfortunate story. As punishment for his greedy and self-serving life his spirit has been condemned to wander the Earth weighted down with heavy chains. Marley hopes to save Scrooge from sharing the same fate. Marley informs Scrooge that three spirits will visit him during each of the next three nights. After the wraith disappears, Scrooge collapses into a deep sleep.</p>\\r\\n<p>He wakes moments before the arrival of the Ghost of Christmas Past, a strange childlike phantom with a brightly glowing head. The spirit escorts Scrooge on a journey into the past to previous Christmases from the curmudgeon\\\'s earlier years. Invisible to those he watches, Scrooge revisits his childhood school days, his apprenticeship with a jolly merchant named Fezziwig, and his engagement to Belle, a woman who leaves Scrooge because his lust for money eclipses his ability to love another. Scrooge, deeply moved, sheds tears of regret before the phantom returns him to his bed.</p>\\r\\n<br>\\r\\n<p>The Ghost of Christmas Present, a majestic giant clad in a green fur robe, takes Scrooge through London to unveil Christmas as it will happen that year. Scrooge watches the large, bustling Cratchit family prepare a miniature feast in its meager home. He discovers Bob Cratchit\\\'s crippled son, Tiny Tim, a courageous boy whose kindness and humility warms Scrooge\\\'s heart. The specter then zips Scrooge to his nephew\\\'s to witness the Christmas party. Scrooge finds the jovial gathering delightful and pleads with the spirit to stay until the very end of the festivities. As the day passes, the spirit ages, becoming noticeably older. Toward the end of the day, he shows Scrooge two starved children, Ignorance and Want, living under his coat. He vanishes instantly as Scrooge notices a dark, hooded figure coming toward him.</p>\\r\\n\\r\\n<p>The Ghost of Christmas Yet to Come leads Scrooge through a sequence of mysterious scenes relating to an unnamed man\\\'s recent death. Scrooge sees businessmen discussing the dead man\\\'s riches, some vagabonds trading his personal effects for cash, and a poor couple expressing relief at the death of their unforgiving creditor. Scrooge, anxious to learn the lesson of his latest visitor, begs to know the name of the dead man. After pleading with the ghost, Scrooge finds himself in a churchyard, the spirit pointing to a grave. Scrooge looks at the headstone and is shocked to read his own name. He desperately implores the spirit to alter his fate, promising to renounce his insensitive, avaricious ways and to honor Christmas with all his heart. Whoosh! He suddenly finds himself safely tucked in his bed.</p>\\r\\n\\r\\n<p>Overwhelmed with joy by the chance to redeem himself and grateful that he has been returned to Christmas Day, Scrooge rushes out onto the street hoping to share his newfound Christmas spirit. He sends a giant Christmas turkey to the Cratchit house and attends Fred\\\'s party, to the stifled surprise of the other guests. As the years go by, he holds true to his promise and honors Christmas with all his heart: he treats Tiny Tim as if he were his own child, provides lavish gifts for the poor, and treats his fellow human beings with kindness, generosity, and warmth.</p>',

    `description`='<p>A mean-spirited, miserly old man named Ebenezer Scrooge sits in his counting-house on a frigid Christmas Eve.

He vanishes instantly as Scrooge notices a dark, hooded figure coming toward him.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>The Ghost of Christmas Yet to Come leads Scrooge through a sequence of mysterious scenes relating to an unnamed man\'s recent death. Scrooge sees businessmen discussing the dead man\'s riches, some vagabonds trading his personal effects for cash, and a poor couple expressing relief at the death of their unforgiving creditor. Scrooge, anxious to learn the lesson of his latest visitor, begs to know the name of the dead man. After pleading with the ghost, Scrooge finds himself in a churchyard, the spirit pointing to a grave. Scrooge looks at the headstone and is shocked to read his own name. He desperately implores the spirit to alter his fate, promising to renounce his insensitive, avaricious ways and to honor Christmas with all his heart. Whoosh! He suddenly finds himself safely tucked in his bed.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Overwhelmed with joy by the chance to redeem himself and grateful that he has been returned to Christmas Day, Scrooge rushes out onto the street hoping to share his newfound Christmas spirit. He sends a giant Christmas turkey to the Cratchit house and attends Fred\'s party, to the stifled surprise of the other guests. As the years go by, he holds true to his promise and honors Christmas with all his heart: he treats Tiny Tim as if he were his own child, provides lavish gifts for the poor, and treats his fellow human beings with kindness, generosity, and warmth.</p>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n',

    `description`='<h1><i>\"Please sir, I want some more.\"<i></h1>\r\n\r\n<p>These are words etched in our imagination. If we want just a little teensy bit more of something-coffee, chicken tenders, cash-we tend to remember the super-pathetic plea of a little orphan in England.</p>\r\n<p>Wait. Why are we, as sophisticated 21st Century citizens, still using a line penned in the 1830\'s when we want a second helping? The short answer: Charles Dickens is awesome.\r\nOliver Twist is one of the most famous novels Charles Dickens ever wrote (which is impressive, given that he wrote fifteen super-popular novels during his life). It\'s a classic rags-to-riches story about an orphan who has to find his way through a city full of criminals, and avoid being corrupted. People read Oliver Twist in Dickens\'s day-and are still reading it now-for the gritty realism with which Dickens portrays working class people and the horrible living conditions of the London slums.</p>\r\n<br>\r\n<p>Oliver Twist is also the second novel Dickens ever wrote, and it was published in installments between 1837 and 1839. Many novels at the time were published serially, meaning that each chapter was issued separately, once a month, over the space of a year or two. And this only upped the hype of his novels.</p>\r\n<p>The publishing of novels in magazines is similar to TV today: each magazine was like a different channel. The Victorians had magazines with different specialties. Bentley\'s Miscellany was like an early Victorian HBO-it pushed the envelope in terms of the type of content that could be published, and a lot of prominent novelists and essayists started out writing for Bentley\'s, including our man Charles Dickens-he started writing the monthly installments of Oliver Twist before he\'d even finished writing his first novel, The Pickwick Papers.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>But while The Pickwick Papers was all fun and games, Twist was dark and gritty. Oliver Twist is an example of a style of novel that was incredibly popular (but widely criticized) from the 1820\'s to the 1840\'s: the \"Newgate novel.\" The Newgate novel takes its name from the Newgate prison, the main prison for felons (pickpockets, thieves, prostitutes, murderers) in London.\r\nThose Newgate novels sold like hotcakes. It seemed like folks couldn\'t get enough of them. But the critics of the Newgate novels thought they were damaging English morals. Because the Newgate novels didn\'t shy away from depicting criminal stuff-prostitution, stealing, and even murder-critics said that reading those novels would desensitize people to violence.\r\n(Hmm, sounds an awful lot like the arguments you hear today against first-person shooter video-games, or games like Grand Theft Auto, doesn\'t it? The next time someone criticizes your taste in video-games, you can try suggesting that, if Dickens were alive today, he might have tried his hand at writing a shooter.)</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Oliver Twist is Dickens\'s only novel that qualifies as a \"Newgate novel,\" though, so it seems like he just wanted to try his hand at the popular style of writing before turning to other, loftier pursuits. We\'re certainly happy that he experimented with the Newgate genre, because we\'re left with the totally entertaining fruits of that experiment.<br>\r\n... as well as the catchphrase \"Please sir, I want some more.\"</p>\r\n\r\n<br>\r\n<br>\r\n\r\n<h1>WHY SHOULD I CARE?</h1>\r\n\r\n<p>Psst. Hey. Hey, Shmooper. Over here.</p>\r\n<p>You look like the kind of person who enjoys literary journeys into the underbelly of society. You look like kind of person who gets a thrill from texts about the mob. Or from nefarious deeds committed in dark alleys by men with ominous mustaches.</p>\r\n<p>We\'re betting you like the really good stuff. The premium stuff. And by \"stuff\" we mean \"TV,\" obviously. Yeah. We bet you like AMC and HBO: meth cooks in New Mexico. Haunted detectives. Grade-A antiheroes.</p>\r\n<p>Well, how would you like to get your kicks with one of the texts that started this whole seedy trend?</p>\r\n<p>People tend to think of Oliver Twist as an old book about a cherubic orphan, but in reality it\'s way more creeptastic and peripheral than that. It\'s about a cherubic orphan, sure. But it\'s really about the worst possible environment for our sweet lil\' Oliver: the original mean streets of London-town and the people that populated them.</p>\r\n<p>Murderers. Pickpockets. Prostitutes. Pimps. Beggars. Drunks. Schemers. Loners. Dreamers. Criminals.</p>\r\n<p>These are the characters at the heart of Oliver Twist-the same cast that shows up every Sunday night on TV. We love them now, and we loved them back in the 1830\'s. In fact, Oliver Twist\'s original serialized form made reading the book way back when a lot like tuning in for your favorite cable mayhem today.</p>\r\n<p>And you know what? It holds up. Even for audiences jaded by too much True Detective, Oliver Twist hits the sweet spot that we know and love: the union of sleazy abjection and great art</p>',

There are bad people in it, Mr. Richard, but if there were no bad people, there would be no good lawyers.\"',        '<p>The Old Curiosity Shop certainly displays the hallmarks of the unstructured, free-flowing make-it-up-as-you-go-along type of story characteristic of Dickens\'s early novels. Indeed, it is rather generous to call it a story, and it\'s difficult now to understand the sensation it caused when it was first published. However, if a page-turning plot was all there was to it, very few of Dickens\'s novels would be readable at all. As ever with Dickens, the pleasure in reading this book comes from the comedy, diversity and richness of the characters, as well as the sheer mastery of the English language which came so naturally to him.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>The central characters are old Trent, his granddaughter Nell, the moneylender Daniel Quilp, young Kit and the wonderful Richard Swiveller. Of these, the spotlessly pure Nell and the irredeemably evil Quilp are the moral opposites around which the book revolves, old Trent is rather a pathetic figure, while Kit\'s sturdy progress from poverty to respectability makes for happier reading. However, it is the moral journey of Swiveller, which perhaps reflects the geographic journey undertaken by Nell and her grandfather, which is the real joy of this book. \r\n</p>\r\n\r\n<p>He enters the book in the guise of a rogue, involved in dubious intrigues with Nell\'s no-good brother and also with the repulsive Quilp. However, from the time that Quilp gets him a job as a clerk in the office of Samson Brass and his sister, the awful Miss Brass, Swiveller\'s basic decency and natural good humour begin to reveal themselves, and his soliloquies and dialogue provide many hilarious moments from that point on. The Dick Swiveller who subsequently meets up with the hapless young girl kept prisoner by Miss Brass is funny, considerate, charming and kind, and a long way from the doubtful type of character that he at first appears to be.\r\nThe book proceeds along two different narrative lines; one which charts the progress of Nell and her grandfather on their long journey, and the other revolving around Swiveller, Quilp and Kit, and to a lesser extent the families of these latter two, as well as \"the single gentleman\" and the little girl memorably christened \"The Marchioness\" by Swiveller. One of the big faults I found with this dual structure is that the characters of one plot line have no contact with those in the other plot line for most of the novel, and it is left to the Quilp, Swiveller and Kit to act out most of the drama. Nell and her grandfather spend most of their time journeying through various scenes of early nineteenth century life in England. Nonetheless these all make for enjoyable reading. One particular scene where Nell and her grandfather sleep beside a furnace in the company of a wretched man who watches the flames is particularly memorable.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>All in all, it\'s not exactly a page-turner, and the ending is not a happy one. I would not recommend this book as an introduction to Dickens, and is best read by people, like myself, who have already decided that anything by Dickens is worth reading. Also it focuses less on London than many Dickens novels, and gives an interesting view of rural, village and town life outside London in those times.</p>',

    `description`='<p>The Old Curiosity Shop certainly displays the hallmarks of the unstructured, free-flowing make-it-up-as-you-go-along type of story characteristic of Dickens\'s early novels. Indeed, it is rather generous to call it a story, and it\'s difficult now to understand the sensation it caused when it was first published. However, if a page-turning plot was all there was to it, very few of Dickens\'s novels would be readable at all. As ever with Dickens, the pleasure in reading this book comes from the comedy, diversity and richness of the characters, as well as the sheer mastery of the English language which came so naturally to him.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>The central characters are old Trent, his granddaughter Nell, the moneylender Daniel Quilp, young Kit and the wonderful Richard Swiveller. Of these, the spotlessly pure Nell and the irredeemably evil Quilp are the moral opposites around which the book revolves, old Trent is rather a pathetic figure, while Kit\'s sturdy progress from poverty to respectability makes for happier reading. However, it is the moral journey of Swiveller, which perhaps reflects the geographic journey undertaken by Nell and her grandfather, which is the real joy of this book. \r\n</p>\r\n\r\n<p>He enters the book in the guise of a rogue, involved in dubious intrigues with Nell\'s no-good brother and also with the repulsive Quilp. However, from the time that Quilp gets him a job as a clerk in the office of Samson Brass and his sister, the awful Miss Brass, Swiveller\'s basic decency and natural good humour begin to reveal themselves, and his soliloquies and dialogue provide many hilarious moments from that point on. The Dick Swiveller who subsequently meets up with the hapless young girl kept prisoner by Miss Brass is funny, considerate, charming and kind, and a long way from the doubtful type of character that he at first appears to be.\r\nThe book proceeds along two different narrative lines; one which charts the progress of Nell and her grandfather on their long journey, and the other revolving around Swiveller, Quilp and Kit, and to a lesser extent the families of these latter two, as well as \"the single gentleman\" and the little girl memorably christened \"The Marchioness\" by Swiveller. One of the big faults I found with this dual structure is that the characters of one plot line have no contact with those in the other plot line for most of the novel, and it is left to the Quilp, Swiveller and Kit to act out most of the drama. Nell and her grandfather spend most of their time journeying through various scenes of early nineteenth century life in England. Nonetheless these all make for enjoyable reading. One particular scene where Nell and her grandfather sleep beside a furnace in the company of a wretched man who watches the flames is particularly memorable.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>All in all, it\'s not exactly a page-turner, and the ending is not a happy one. I would not recommend this book as an introduction to Dickens, and is best read by people, like myself, who have already decided that anything by Dickens is worth reading. Also it focuses less on London than many Dickens novels, and gives an interesting view of rural, village and town life outside London in those times.</p>',
