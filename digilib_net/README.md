# Project Digilib_net

##What is it?
-----------
Community Collaburated Educational Website seeking to Rebuild the learning process of todays Educational system and create a nice Interactive Way of teaching anybody, anywhere, everything.

##Licensing
-----------
Please see the file called LICENSE.

##Programming Language
-----------
Out of the vast Number of language, we found PHP, MySql, And Apache Server to be best suited for our project needs given the requirement for 100% compatibility b/w different platforms(mostly 4:CentOS4, Ubuntu Utopic/velevt, Windows 7 Pro x64, OSX 10.6 and up).

##Documentation
-----------
All of the code is heavily commented so there may not be need for a seperate documentaion but community efforts are welcomed. You might want to create an issue if you don't understand the code.

##Softwares and tools
-----------
Our dedicated team LOVES open source softwares! We go by Eclipse IDE for php coding and debugging and currently targeting Html5 browsers(IE8 compatible now!). Project Uses and include Jquery and Gsap Libraries and code styleshet in basic CSS. We are hoping for an cross-browser, cross-platform and cross-device compatiblity by the end of the project.
